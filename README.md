# HolidayPlanner

A simple app that lets you choose a typical European holiday destination, view the weather for that location and see excursions offered by our hypothetical travel agency.

This app was created for a technical test for a role I applied for so its scope is limited to demonstrating competency in a number of key areas such as basic app architecture, Swift, consuming JSON and using a RESTful API. The app may need an API key from https://openweathermap.org to be useful.

App Features

- Swift 4.2/5
- Simple MVVM architecture
- Consumes RESTful API from Open Weather Map for weather forecasts
- Handling async network calls
- Custom cells
